; Problem 4 approach: simultaneously start outward from each exit, and whenever
; a cell that's not labeled and can be is encountered, set it to wherever the
; search 'came from'.
; This is a multi-headed Dijkstra, first-to-a-point-wins, âˆµ distance metric and
; adjacency are both Manhatton to the cardinal directions, each hop costing 1.
; Don't have to worry about 'ties' since both solutions to any 'tie' would be
; equal given how we're traversing it; a later check is guaranteed to have a 
; distance cost equal to or higher than a prior one.
